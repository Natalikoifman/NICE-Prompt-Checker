# NICE Prompt Checker

AI-powered Microsoft Teams bot for analyzing, validating, and generating survey prompts. Helps create effective, unbiased, and clear survey questions.

## Features

- **Clarity Analysis**: Checks if questions are clear and easy to understand
- **Bias Detection**: Identifies potentially biased or leading language
- **Double-Barreled Detection**: Catches questions asking multiple things at once
- **Length Assessment**: Flags questions that are too long or complex
- **Instant Feedback**: Get actionable suggestions in real-time

## Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Node.js 16+ installed
   - Microsoft Azure account
   - ngrok for local testing

2. **Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/Natalikoifman/NICE-Prompt-Checker.git
   cd NICE-Prompt-Checker
   
   # Install dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Configure environment
   cp .env.sample .env
   # Edit .env with your Azure Bot credentials
   
   # Start the bot

## How It Works

Simply send your survey prompt to the bot, and it will analyze:

**Example Input:**
```
Don't you agree that employees should always work overtime?
```

**Bot Response:**
- Clarity Score: 7/10 ⚠️
- Bias Score: 3/10 ❌
- Issues: Leading question detected, biased language
- Suggestions: Remove "Don't you agree", replace "always" with neutral language

## Analysis Features

### Clarity Checks
- Question mark presence
- Sentence length and complexity
- Word count analysis
- Readability assessment

### Bias Detection

- Loaded questions
- Suggestive phrasing

### Best Practices
- Single-topic questions
- Neutral language

## Configuration

Environment variables (in `.env`):

```bash
# Required
MicrosoftAppId=<your-bot-app-id>
MicrosoftAppPassword=<your-bot-app-password>
MicrosoftAppType=MultiTenant

# Optional
PORT=3978
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<for-advanced-ai-features>
```

## Extending the Bot

To add more analysis features:

1. Edit `src/bot.js`
2. Add new checks in the `analyzePrompt()` method
3. Update the response card format as needed
4. Test locally, then redeploy

Example - Adding sentiment analysis:
```javascript
analyzeSentiment(prompt) {
    // Your sentiment analysis logic
    return score;
}
```
